```lrc
[00:52.01] We don't care what they say
[00:54.75] We will be here all day
[00:57.38] We'll stay here till it's over
[01:00.83] Till the world's out of sight
[01:03.56] We will stand, we will fight
[01:04.75] It's not over till it's over
[01:18.75] 
[01:05.80] As I fell to the ocean floor
[02:19.82] Feeling light through an open door
[02:22.06] Saw myself rise with the water
[02:24.17] They thought they could keep me down
[02:28.35] Hold their breath and watch me drown
[02:30.66] But all they did has pushed me higher
[02:49.16] 
[02:33.00] We don't care what they say
[02:36.87] We will be here all day
[02:39.53] We'll stay here till it's over
[02:41.70] Till the world's out of sight
[02:45.37] We will stand, we will fight
[02:48.05] It's not over till it's over
[03:02.05] 
[02:49.52] Through the night and the rain
[02:50.40] Through the time and the pain
[02:54.25] We'll stand and we'll never fall
[02:56.91] And then at the end of it all
[02:59.37] We will win, we will chant
[03:02.61] It's not over till it's over
