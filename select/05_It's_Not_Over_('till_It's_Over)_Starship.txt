Hey, listen

We don't call the shots here
We don't make the rules
We take what we get
Get what we can
And it's learning the hard way
Here on the streets
You can't build a dream without a plan

Action speaks
Let them hear you speak
Play for keeps
The play to win
We play for keeps
It's not over till it's over
It's not over till we get it right

The odds are all against us
They say we don't stand a chance
But there's no giving up
No giving in
When push comes to shove
You got to fight for what you love
You do what you must
Do what you can

Action speaks
Let them hear you speak
Play for keeps
The play to win
We play for keeps
It's not over till it's over
It's not over till we get it right

It's not over till it's over
So, so give it in
It's not over till we get it right

Get it right

The odds are all against us
But you know we still stand a chance
There's no giving up
No giving in
It's not over
(It's not over till it's over)
It's not over till we, till we, till we
(It's not over) Till we, till we get it right
(It's not over till it's over)
(It's not over) Till we, till we get it right
(It's not over till it's over)
So don't give it in now
(It's not over) Till we get it right
Believe it
(It's not over till it's over)
Don't you go givin' in
Don't go givin' up
