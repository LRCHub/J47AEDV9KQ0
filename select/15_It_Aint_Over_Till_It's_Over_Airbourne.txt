Sweatin' it out upon the stage
Thankful to be out of the cage
I got no fear 'cause I don't feel pain
Come on, baby, let's do it again
[Chorus]
It ain't over till it's over
It ain't over till it's over
It ain't over till it's over
It ain't over till it's over
I'm gonna ride this train till the end of the line
Love this bitch till the morning light
Drinking all the beer that I can find
Come on, baby, won't you be mine?
No slowing down, got no self sense
Hit the gas, honey; it's rocking time
[Chorus]
It ain't over, over
No, it ain't
Let's rock-'n'-roll
Over, over, not for me
It ain't over, over
No, it ain't
Let's rock-'n'-roll
Till the fat lady, fat lady, fat lady screams
Let it rock
It ain't over
Until it's over
Sweatin' it out upon the stage
Thankful to be out of the cage
No slowing down, got no self sense
Hit the gas, honey; it's rocking time
It ain't over till it's over
It ain't over till it's over
It ain't over till it's over
It ain't over till it's over
It ain't over, over, not for me
It's rock-'n'-roll
Over, over, no, it ain't, all right
It ain't over, over, not for me
It never will be
Until the fat lady, fat lady, fat lady screams
Rock-'n'-roll
It ain't over (till it's over)
It ain't over (till it's over)
It ain't over (till it's over)
It ain't over till it's over
I'm gonna ride this train till the end of the line
Love this bitch till the morning light
